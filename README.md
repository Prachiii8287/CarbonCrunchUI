# CarbonCrunchUI

## 🌟 Overview

**CarbonCrunchUI** is a web application designed to automate carbon data collection, streamline sustainability reporting, and provide insightful visualizations to help organizations monitor and reduce their carbon footprint.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is built using **React** with **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds.

### 📦 Installation

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (recommended version: LTS). Then, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository

# Navigate into the project folder
cd CarbonCrunchUI

# Install dependencies
npm install

🏃 Running the Project
To start the development server, run:
npm run dev
This will launch the app and provide a local development URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

🏗️ Building for Production

🛤️ Development Approach
The development of CarbonCrunchUI follows a modular and component-driven approach:

Component-Based Architecture: Each UI element is developed as an independent component, promoting reusability and maintainability.

Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, allowing for rapid UI development with utility classes. This approach ensures a consistent and responsive design across the application.

Animations: Framer Motion integrates smoothly with React to add animations and transitions, enhancing user experience without compromising performance.

Performance Optimization: Vite's fast build and hot module replacement (HMR) capabilities accelerate development and ensure optimized production builds.

Code Quality: ESLint and Prettier are configured to maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.

Version Control: Git is used for version control, with a branching strategy to manage features, bug fixes, and releases effectively.
